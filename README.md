# Probability Theory and Introductory Statistics

# Here the list of assignments completed.
# First. 
Hypothesis testing and relationhip between variables in the dataset: For each test, I have documented the dependent and independent variable, hypothesis testing steps and the results at each step. Finally, provided an analysis of the final results with an explanation of the interpretation.
# Second.
Produced several descriptive statistics tables (i.e. mean, SD, min, max, and N) for the entire sample, and by group (for example, by the class=1 to 4). Also used psych::describe( ) commands of your choice. orked on three-line table format that is commonly used in white papers. Provided several interpretive sentences with your table outputs. 
# Third
Conducted a one-sample t-tests for mean using an appropriate variable from the data set and Used the t.test( ) in R. Provided the null and the alternative hypothesis for each testa ell as test results and several sentences interpreting the results.
Performed hypothesis testing for p-value using an appropriate variable from the data sets. Provided the null and the alternative hypothesis for each test Also Provided the test results and several sentences interpreting the results.
# Fourth
Two-sample t-test with unequal variance:
1. Using the “cats” dataset, answered the question: do male and female cat samples have the same bodyweight. 

2. Evaluated whether meditation has an effect on sleep quality, 10 students were recruited for a meditation workshop. They agreed to wear sleeping evaluators to measure their sleeping quality. The sleeping quality is on the scale 0-10 (the higher the better).
The average sleeping quality scores in the week before the workshop were: 4.6, 7.8, 9.1, 5.6, 6.9, 8.5, 5.3, 7.1, 3.2, 4.4.
The average sleeping quality scores in the week following the workshop were: 6.6, 7.7, 9.0, 6.2, 7.8, 8.3, 5.9, 6.5, 5.8, 4.9.
Quetion: The researchers claimed that meditation improves sleeping quality. Is it true?
Listed all steps of your testing procedure clearly (using α = 0.05) including
stating your hypotheses,
your code,
your output and
your findings along with interpretation.
# Fifth
Used the real_estate_valuation dataset, examine and test the relationships between several variables that you deem of interest for the purpose of investigating real estate value.
Produced and exported at least one correlation table or correlation chart and Provided some conclusions, describing the key analytical findings.
Produced and exported at least three regression model. and ansered the question  How does regression analysis differ from correlation analysis? Provide some interpretation of the key results.
# Sixth
1. Using an appropriate variable, created a dummy variables to subset the dataset. Then reran regression line for the dependent variable and ansered the question such as How many subsets did you create? How many lines are there? Then Created a scatterplot with multiple regression lines, and shown  impact of the categorical variable on the regression? 
2. Used the appropriate subsetted data from step 1, created separate regression lines for each subset.
